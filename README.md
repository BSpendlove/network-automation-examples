## Network Automation Examples

This repository includes examples interacting with network devices in different languages (mainly python) and to demonstrate interaction between different protocols such as:

SSH/CLI Scraping, Netconf, HTTP/RESTful APIs, etc...

You'll find a basic overview in the example folder README discussing what it demonstrates. These examples are to introduce the aspiring network engineer/system administrator into network programability in a less formal approach. Examples are not designed to be perfect but to show advantages, disadvantages, programming logic and much more! Some are designed to allow the reader to interact with a basic script and get involved with implementing code to perform common tasks such as data validation, error checking and code optimization.

This repository will be filled with many different examples in the near future. This is just a bit of fun to try to attract those looking to get into network programmability/scripting who don't currently have the motiviation or resources to start learning.
